  "Reading THORChain, so a validator can attest what it saw.

  The escrow is THORChain: a user sends an asset to the network's inbound
  vault with a memo naming their torihiki account, THORChain's own validators
  observe it into their consensus, and the asset sits behind a key no single
  party holds. `torihiki.state/deposit-attest` decides when that becomes
  collateral here — it needs a quorum of bonded validators to say the same
  thing about the same transaction.

  This namespace is the half that turns THORChain's answers into that claim.
  It is **pure**: it takes parsed JSON and returns transactions to sign. The
  polling, the HTTP and the signing live in the node, because those are the
  parts that cannot be tested without a network and this is the part that must
  be.

  ## The memo is the whole binding

  Nothing about a THORChain transfer says which torihiki account it belongs
  to. The memo does, and a memo is user-supplied text, so it is parsed
  strictly: the exact prefix, then digits, and nothing else. A memo that does
  not parse is not a deposit for anybody — crediting a best guess would mean
  crediting an account the sender did not name."

  THORChain reports an inbound as soon as its own validators have observed it,
  and its own reorg handling is what makes that final — but a validator here
  that attests at depth zero is attesting something that can still be undone,

  transactions a validator would attest.

  `me` is the attesting validator's account id. `vaults` is the SET of inbound
  addresses this venue accepts — an observation naming anything else is
  somebody else's deposit, and checking it here is what stops a validator from
  being talked into attesting a transfer that never reached us.

  A SET, not one address, because THORChain's vaults churn: the network
  rotates its asgard every few days, and a deposit sent to the outgoing vault
  minutes before the rotation is still a real deposit. Watching one address
  means that, on every churn, deposits stop being credited and nothing says
  so — the venue keeps running and quietly stops taking money. The set is the
  current inbound plus the ones this validator has seen before.

  Returns a vector of `:deposit-attest` transactions, one per usable
  observation, in the order given. Anything unusable is DROPPED rather than
  reported: a validator that cannot read an observation has nothing to say
  about it, and saying something anyway is the failure this whole path exists
  to avoid."
