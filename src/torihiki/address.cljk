(ns torihiki.address
  "Which account id a public key owns.

  `torihiki.auth` states the rule and takes the derivation as a parameter,
  because that namespace has no crypto and a browser that cannot hash still
  has to be able to replay a block. This is the concrete derivation, in one
  place, for everybody who needs to agree on it: the engine, the node, and the
  browser that decides which account to trade as.

  One implementation and not three. The browser computing its own address and
  the chain computing a different one is a user who cannot sign for the
  account they are shown, and the symptom — a rejection naming the account —
  looks like a permissions problem rather than an arithmetic one.

  ## Why 45 bits

  The book stores owners in a slab of i53, so the id has room; 45 bits keeps
  it well inside that with the floor added and puts a collision at tens of
  millions of accounts rather than tens of thousands. A collision is REFUSED
  rather than silent — the loser gets `:wrong-key`, sees it, and uses another
  key — which is what makes the derivation better than the first-use race it
  replaces, not merely different. See `torihiki.auth`.

  ## Why a floor

  Ids below `floor` belong to the clearinghouse's own roles: the backstop
  vault and the oracle publishers are small integers configured at genesis. A
  derived id landing on one would be a key claiming a role, which is a
  different kind of mistake from claiming somebody's account and a worse one."
