(ns torihiki.principal
  "Which Stable Principal an account belongs to, so a key can be replaced
  without the account being lost.

  ## The problem this exists for

  `torihiki.address/derive` makes the account id a FUNCTION OF THE KEY. That
  is what stops a proposer front-running a registration, and it is right. It
  also means a holder who rotates their key gets a different account —
  positions, collateral and open orders all stay behind on an id whose key is
  gone. There is no recovery, because there is nothing on the chain that says
  the two keys are the same person.

  A Stable Principal is that statement. `auth.kotoba.cloud` already issues one
  (`kotoba-lang/app-kotoba-cloud`): a Passkey ceremony, or an Ethereum wallet
  through `authentication`'s `:siwe` factor, resolves to a `principalId` that
  outlives any single credential. This namespace is the chain's side of it.

  ## Two signatures, because one authority would be too much

  Binding is deliberately a two-step handshake, and neither party can do it
  alone:

  - `:principal-claim` — the ACCOUNT OWNER says which principal they are. It
    records a pending claim and nothing else.
  - `:principal-confirm` — the CONTROLLER says the same, for the same account
    and principal. Only then is the binding written.

  The owner cannot bind a principal the controller will not confirm, so
  squatting somebody else's principal id buys nothing: the claim sits pending
  forever and the real holder's claim is still confirmable. The controller
  cannot bind an account that never claimed, so it cannot quietly enrol
  accounts that never asked for it.

  That matters because of what the binding then permits:

  - `:principal-rotate` — the CONTROLLER replaces an account's owner key.

  Rotation is real authority over somebody's money, and the two-step bind is
  what bounds it: **an account that never claimed a principal can never be
  rotated**, whatever the controller does. Opting in is the only way in, and
  it is a signature from the account itself.

  ## Why there is no new signature scheme here

  `:controller-authority` is an ACCOUNT ID, exactly as `:bridge-authority` is.
  The controller submits ordinary signed envelopes, so `torihiki.auth` does
  the verification, the controller's own nonce makes each attestation
  single-use, and `signing-payload` already binds it to the chain id. A
  separate attestation signature would have been a second scheme to keep
  correct, with its own replay window and its own way of being bound to the
  wrong chain.

  Pure: no crypto, no clock, no I/O. `torihiki.auth` has already established
  who signed by the time anything here is called."

  Proposing, not doing. `rotate-propose` records it and `mature-rotations`
  applies it `rotation-delay` blocks later, and in between the account's own
  key can cancel.

  ## Why a controller that can take an account instantly is not trustworthy

  The two-step bind already bounds this authority to accounts that opted in
  with their own signature, which is what stops the controller enrolling
  people. It does nothing about the account that DID opt in: `auth.kotoba.cloud`
  compromised, or coerced, or simply wrong, could hand somebody's positions to
  a key of its choosing between one block and the next, and the holder would
  find out afterwards.

  A delay does not remove that authority — nothing here can, because key
  recovery IS the authority to replace a key. It makes the authority
  ANSWERABLE: the holder sees the proposal, and while they still hold the key
  they are replacing, they can refuse.

  **The tension is real and is not hidden.** Whoever holds the current key can
  cancel, and if that key was stolen the thief can cancel a legitimate
  recovery. The delay protects against a rogue controller and not against a
  stolen key; those are different attacks and this answers one of them. A
  chain that wants the other answer sets `rotation-delay-blocks` to 0 and says
  so.

  The account must already be BOUND — a pending claim is not enough. A claim
  is one signature from a key that may itself be the one being replaced, and
  letting it authorise rotation would collapse the handshake into a single
  step taken by whoever holds the key at that moment."
