  "Conditional orders: stop-loss and take-profit, as pure data.

  A trigger is an order that does not exist yet. It sits outside the book —
  invisible to everyone, consuming no depth — until the mark crosses its
  trigger price, at which point it becomes an ordinary order and is submitted
  like any other.

  ## Why this namespace is separate

  Deciding WHICH triggers fire is a total function of (triggers, mark). Doing
  something about it — placing orders, moving the book, repricing the mark —
  is the state machine's job. Keeping the decision here means it can be tested
  exhaustively without a book, and means the firing rule is written down in
  one place rather than smeared through `apply-tx`.

  ## The firing rule is a consensus rule

  Two triggers can become due on the same mark, and the order they fire in
  changes the fills both of them get. That makes it a consensus rule, not an
  implementation detail: two validators that fire them in different orders
  produce different books.

  So the order is total and stated: **by `:id`, the sequence number assigned
  when the trigger was created.** Any total order would be safe; creation
  order is chosen because it is the one nobody can game. Sorting by trigger
  price would let a trader buy priority by choosing a price fractionally
  closer to the mark; sorting by size would let them buy it with size.

  ## Direction

  `:above` fires when the mark reaches or passes the trigger price from below,
  `:below` when it reaches or passes from above. Both are inclusive: a mark
  exactly at the trigger price fires it. A stop-loss on a long is `:below`; a
  take-profit on a long is `:above`.")
