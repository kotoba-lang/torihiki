(ns torihiki.clearing
  "The perpetuals clearinghouse: positions, margin, and the equity test that
  decides whether an account is still solvent.

  Everything here is a pure function of an immutable state map. Unlike
  `torihiki.book`, which mutates preallocated arrays because it is called
  hundreds of thousands of times a second, the clearinghouse runs once per
  fill and once per mark-price update, so ordinary Clojure data is both fast
  enough and much easier to reason about — and reasoning about it is the
  point, because THIS is the layer where money is actually lost.

  ## Model

  An account holds `:collateral` (integer, in the quote asset's smallest unit)
  and a map of `:positions` keyed by market id. A position is

    {:size <signed lots>          ; positive = long, negative = short
     :entry-notional <signed>     ; running cost basis, same sign as size
     :isolated <collateral or nil>}

  Cost basis is carried as a NOTIONAL rather than as an average entry price,
  because an average price forces a division on every fill and a division
  forces a rounding decision on every fill. Accumulating the notional exactly
  and dividing only when someone asks for the entry price moves all the
  rounding to one place.

  ## Margin

  Following Hyperliquid's published parameters: maintenance margin is half the
  initial margin at maximum leverage, so a market that allows 40x has 2.5%
  initial and 1.25% maintenance, and one that allows 3x has 33.3% initial and
  16.7% maintenance. An account is liquidatable when its equity falls below
  the sum of its positions' maintenance requirements.

  Cross margin pools collateral across every position. Isolated margin fences
  a stated amount to one position, so that position's liquidation cannot reach
  the rest of the account — which also means its equity test must exclude the
  cross pool entirely."

(defn market
  "A market's risk parameters. `max-leverage` is the only number an operator
  sets; initial and maintenance margin are derived from it so the pair can
  never be configured inconsistently.

  `margin-tiers` is optional: a vector of `{:max-notional n :max-leverage l}`
  in ascending order of size. A position pays the rate of the first tier whose
  `:max-notional` it fits inside; anything past the last tier pays the last
  tier's rate. Without tiers every position pays the same rate regardless of
  size, which is how a large position ends up under-collateralised — the book
  cannot absorb it at the price the margin assumed, and the difference is paid
  by the insurance fund or by ADL.

  `open-interest-cap` is optional and is checked by `torihiki.api`.

  `symbol` is what a human calls this market. Not used by any arithmetic here
  and committed to the state root all the same: it is what a terminal puts on
  a trade ticket, so two replicas that disagreed about it would label the same
  position two different things."

  Fee tiers are supposed to reward RECENT activity, so the number they read has

  A rolling window needs a clock and the engine has none — so the window is
  blocks. Volume is kept per epoch and the tier reads the current epoch plus
  the previous one, which is a window between one and two epochs wide
  depending on where in the current one you ask. That wobble is the price of
  not having a clock, and it is bounded and identical on every replica, which
  a wall-clock window would not be."

(defn settle-deficit
  "Move an account's negative collateral into `:deficit`, leaving collateral at
  zero. Idempotent, and a no-op on an account that is not underwater.

  ## Why the debt moves instead of staying where it was

  Collateral going negative is how the liquidation waterfall records a hole:
  `torihiki.liquidation` hands the position to the vault at the mark, and when
  that costs more than the account had, the difference sits on the account as
  a negative number. The insurance fund adds back what it can cover; anything
  it cannot stays negative forever.

  A negative balance is a true statement in the wrong field. It is a DEBT, and
  storing it as collateral means the one number an exchange must be able to
  add up — what it owes its users — cannot be added up, because part of the
  sum is a hole rather than a holding. `torihiki.commit` had to keep every
  merkle-sum leaf at zero for exactly this reason: a sum that is only valid
  while nobody is underwater is a claim that fails when it matters most.

  Split into two non-negative fields, both are true and both are usable.
  `:collateral` is what the account has and what reserves must cover;
  `:deficit` is what it owes and what a later deposit pays down first. The
  identity `collateral - deficit` is the old single number, so nothing is
  invented and nothing is forgiven.

  Bad debt does NOT reduce equity. It was already absorbed — by the insurance
  fund, or socialised onto counterparties by auto-deleveraging — so charging
  it to the account again would double-count the loss AND put equity back
  below zero, which is the state this exists to remove."
