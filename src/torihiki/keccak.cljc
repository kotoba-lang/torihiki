(ns torihiki.keccak
  "Keccak-256, the hash Ethereum addresses storage with.

  `torihiki.evm.interp` needs it and stopped short of it deliberately: Solidity
  computes a mapping slot by hashing the key with the slot number, so a
  contract that uses a mapping cannot run without one. Approximating it is not
  an option — a hash that is not keccak gives a different slot for the same
  key, and the contract would read and write real storage at addresses no
  other implementation agrees with. Wrong quietly, and only for the contracts
  that hold the most.

  ## 32-bit halves, not big integers

  A Keccak lane is 64 bits. JavaScript has no 64-bit integer except BigInt,
  and BigInt arithmetic in this namespace would be both slow and — as this
  session has now measured twice — the place where the two runtimes stop
  agreeing. So a lane is a PAIR of 32-bit values and every operation is
  `bit-and`, `bit-xor` and the shifts, masked to 32 bits.

  Those are exact on both sides: ClojureScript's bit operations are 32-bit by
  definition, and masking a JVM long to `0xFFFFFFFF` makes it the same number.
  There is no arithmetic here at all, which is the point — nothing to coerce.

  Not the sponge in general and not SHA3: Keccak-256 with the original
  padding, which is what Ethereum uses and what `keccak256` in Solidity means."
