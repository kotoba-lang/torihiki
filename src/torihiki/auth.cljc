  "Who is allowed to move an account, and how a signature stops being reusable.

  Until this existed, `:account` was a number a client asserted. Anyone could
  submit a transaction claiming to be account 5 and the engine would apply it.
  The API validated the SHAPE of a request and never asked who sent it.

  ## Why authentication lives in the engine, not the transport

  It looks like a transport concern and it is not. Two of its three parts are
  consensus state:

  - the **nonce** is per-account state, and every validator must agree on its
    value or they disagree about which transactions are replays;
  - the **key binding** is per-account state, for the same reason;
  - only the *framing* — HTTP headers, a WebSocket envelope — belongs to a
    transport, and that part is the easy half.

  Putting nonces in a server would mean a chain whose replay protection lives
  outside the thing that agrees on state, which is not replay protection.

  ## The signed payload

  `signing-payload` covers the chain id, the account, the nonce, and every
  field of the transaction. Each of those is load-bearing:

  - **chain id** is domain separation. A signature produced on a testnet must
    not authorise the same transaction on the mainnet, and the only thing that
    stops it is the signature covering which chain it was for.
  - **nonce** is what makes the signature single-use.
  - **every field** — a payload that summarised the transaction would let two
    different transactions share one signature.

  ## Keys, accounts, and what this does not solve

  The KEY is the identity; the id is a short handle for it. Binding is
  immutable — a rebindable account is an account that can be stolen from
  whoever holds the key.

  ## Which id a key may bind, and why first-use was not enough

  With `derive-fn` supplied, a key may only bind the id DERIVED FROM IT. That
  closes an attack that first-use binding does not survive under consensus:
  the party ordering transactions sees a pending binding before it commits and
  can insert its own binding for that id first. Under a single sequencer the
  owner is always first, which is why this was invisible until four replicas
  ran with a Byzantine leader — it claimed the account, and the genuine owner
  was refused `:wrong-key` on their own id, permanently.

  The earlier note here said deriving the id trades a registration race for an
  account collision, and that this was worse. That was the wrong comparison. A
  collision is REFUSED — the second key gets `:wrong-key`, sees it, and can
  use another key — while the race is silent, permanent, and profitable for
  whoever orders the transactions. And the slab holds i53, not 32 bits, so the
  space is large enough that a collision needs tens of millions of accounts
  rather than tens of thousands.

  `derive-fn` is injected for the same reason `verify-fn` is: this namespace
  has no crypto and a browser that cannot hash is still allowed to replay.
  Without one, ids remain first-come — which is correct for replaying a
  history already agreed and wrong anywhere a proposer can front-run.

  ## Injected verification

  `verify-fn` receives `[pubkey payload sig]` and returns truthy when the
  signature is good. Nothing here imports crypto, for the same reason
  `torihiki.log` does not: `kotoba-lang/ed25519` is JVM-only, and a browser
  that cannot re-verify a block is not a verifier."
